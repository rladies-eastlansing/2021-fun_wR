# Lightning Talks
## üéµ Andrea Sanchez-Tapia on sambaR

Andrea will present her package, sambaR. sambaR is a simple R package that downloads song lyrics from the Genius database and translates them into the language of your choice using functions from packages genius and googleLanguageR. It has a built-in shiny app and saves results to a disk. It was written to show sambas to our English and Spanish-speaking friends, and a way to practice package writing and shiny, and to learn about APIs.

## üéâ Stephanie Hickey on BRRR (by Brooke Watson Madubuonwu)

‚ÄúHave you ever wanted to know - and celebrate - when your scripts are finally done running in R? Have you ever been so proud of pulling off a tricky bit of code that you wanted Flavor Flav to yell "yeaaahhhh, boi!!" as soon as it successfully completes? Have you ever gotten an error message that felt like DJ Khaled yelling, "They don't wanna see us win!" Probably not, but you might now. And with BRRR, you can.‚Äù
